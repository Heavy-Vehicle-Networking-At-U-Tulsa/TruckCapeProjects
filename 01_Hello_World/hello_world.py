#!/usr/bin/env python3

# Hello, and welcome to your first Python program!

# Lines beginning with a '#' are called comments, and they are ignored by the compiler
# They're used by programmers to leave notes about the code, to help other programmers
# (or themselves) understand the code better.

# Comments begin anywhere after a #, so you can have a comment begin after valid code

to_print = "Hello World!" #See?

# In the above line, we declared a variable called to_print and assigned it the value
# "Hello World!" Notice how, unlike in our Arduino code, we didn't need to give it a
# type. That's because Python uses something called "dynamic typing" where the
# interpreter figures out what the type of something is at runtime.

# Now we're going to do something called a "function call." Function calls take the form
# function_name(a, b, c,) where a, b, and c are arguments.

# For your first assignment, call the function "print" with a single argument, "to_print"
