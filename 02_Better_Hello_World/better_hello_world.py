# OK, now we're going to do a slightly more complicated Hello World

# First, declare two variables.

# Here, declare one called print1 with the value "Hello, world!"


# Now here, declare another one called print2 with the value "Nice to see you!"


# This bit here is called a loop. It executes a block of code multiple times
for i in range(10): #Notice how a line that begins a block ends with a colon.
    if (i % 2) == 0:
        #print print1 here. Line the function call up with this comment
    else:
        #print print2 here

# You had to line up the function calls because python uses spaces to group
# code into blocks. This is different from how Arduino uses curly braces to
# delimit blocks.
