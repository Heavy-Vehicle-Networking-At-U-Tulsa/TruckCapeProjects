# TruckCapeProjects
Projects teaching the basics of using the TruckDuck or Truck Cape on a Beagle Bone Black with Python.

The Linux image to run on the BeagleBone's eMMC can be downloaded, decompressed, imaged to an SD card. When the BeagleBone Black boots from the SD card, it will burn the eMMC to have the necessary contents to run the exercises in this repository. More specifically, the image will have the following:

1. ARM Linux Kernel 3. 
  
  ```uname -a```
  
  ```Linux truck-duck 3.8.13+ #3 SMP Fri Jul 1 14:46:43 CDT 2016 armv7l armv7l armv7l GNU/Linux```
  
2. J1939 Kernel Extension
3. can-utils
4. py-hv-drivers
5. Python 3.5.2
